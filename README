This is the README file for the reminder list that is stored in sqlite.  The capability uses two
programs.

1. First, execute the program todo_setup.rb.  This sets up the database and the corresponding schema needed
for all further operations.

2.  Next, execute the program todo_list.rb.  This program allows the user to add tasks to the list, view the
items on the list, delete item, and change the status from complete to not complete, and vice versa.  All
inputs in the control operations are checked to verify that they are valid entries.

Note: No database is included in the git repository.  The setup program will generate and configure
the db as needed.
